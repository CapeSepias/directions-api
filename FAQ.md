## What is one credit?

You can use [the estimator in the dashboard](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/pricing) or get more detailes of how credits are calculated here:

 * one Routing API request costs 1 credit. Every 10 via-points will cost 1 additional credit. E.g. 11 via-points cost 2 credits
 * one Geocoding API request costs 1 credit
 * one Matrix API request with some start locations and some destinations costs `start * destinations / 4` credits. For example you have 2 start locations and 10 destinations the charged credits are `2 * 10 / 4 = 5`
