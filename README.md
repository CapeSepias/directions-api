Web API
=======

This is a repository of the hosted GraphHopper Web API solution, but for issue tracking only. The JSON format of the hosted Web API is 100% identical to the [Open Source API](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/docs/web/api-doc.md) response format.

To use it you need credentials, please [contact us](http://graphhopper.com/#enterprise).

If you are not (yet ;)) a customer or found a bug directly in the Open Source Web API please report it [here](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues) instead.
