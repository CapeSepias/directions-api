GraphHopper Web API
=======

With [GraphHopper Web API](http://graphhopper.com/#enterprise) it is possible to get the 
fastest path between two or more locations. Additionally to the Open Source API it is 
possible to use addresses as location, not only coordinates. This process is called *Geocoding*.


## How to Start

 1. To use the API you need credentials, please [contact us](http://graphhopper.com/#enterprise).
 2. Read the documentation for the **Routing**, **Geocoding** and **Isochrone** API is available [here](./docs.md). 

Also you can see routing and geocoding in action at [GraphHopper Maps](http://graphhopper.com/maps).

## Issues

If you have problems please report them [here](https://github.com/graphhopper/web-api/issues). 
If you are not a customer or found a bug directly in the Open Source code please report it 
[here](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues) instead.
