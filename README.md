GraphHopper Web API
=======

With [GraphHopper Web API](http://graphhopper.com/#enterprise) it is possible to get the 
fastest path between two or more locations. Additionally to the Open Source API it is 
possible to use addresses as location, not only coordinates. This process is called *Geocoding*.
